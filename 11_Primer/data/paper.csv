DP FAMNIT,Vulnerability bounds on the number of spanning tree leaves,10.26493/1855-3974.37.5b9,CC BY 4.0,"Hamiltonicity and vulnerability of graphs are in a strong connection. A basic necessary condition states that a graph containing a 2-leaf spanning tree (that is a Hamiltonian path) cannot be split into more than k + 1 components by deleting k of its vertices. In this paper we consider a more general approach and investigate the connection between the number of spanning tree leaves and two vulnerability parameters namely scattering number sc(G) and cut-asymmetry ca(G). We prove that any spanning tree of a graph G has at least sc(G) + 1 leaves. We also show that if X $\subset$ V is a maximum cardinality independent set of G = (V, E) such that the elements of X are all leaves of a particular spanning tree then |X| = ca(G) + 1 = |V| − cvc(G), where cvc(G) is the size of a minimum connected vertex cover of G. As a consequence we obtain a new proof for the following results: any spanning tree with independent leaves provides a 2-approximation for both MaximumInternalSpanningTree and MinimumConnectedVertexCover problems.

In the design of soliton circuits, the deterministic property of the corresponding automata is of primary importance. The underlying graphs of such automata, called deterministic soliton graphs, are characterized in terms of graphs not having even-length cycles and graphs having a unique perfect matching. On the basis of this characterization, a modification of the currently most efficient unique perfect matching algorithm is worked out to decide in O(m log4 n) time if a graph with n vertices and m edges defines a deterministic soliton automaton. A yet more efficient O(m) algorithm is given for the special case of chestnut and elementary soliton graphs.

DP FAMNIT,The genus crossing number,10.26493/1855-3974.21.157,CC BY 4.0,"Pach and Tóth [PT] introduced a new version of the crossing number parameter, called the degenerate crossing number, by considering proper drawings of a graph in the plane and counting multiple crossing of edges through the same point as a single crossing when all pairwise crossings of edges at that point are transversal. We propose a related parameter, called the genus crossing number, where edges in the drawing need not be represented by simple arcs. This relaxation has two important advantages. First, the genus crossing number is invariant under taking subdivisions of edges and is also a minor-monotone graph invariant. Secondly, it is “computable” in many instances, which is a rare phenomenon in the theory of crossing numbers. These facts follow from the proof that the genus crossing number is indeed equal to the non-orientable genus of the graph. It remains an open question if the genus crossing number can be strictly smaller than the degenerate crossing number of Pach and Tóth. A relation to the minor crossing number introduced by Bokal, Fijavž, and Mohar [BFM] is also discussed.

The motion of A acting on X is defined as the largest integer k such that all non-trivial elements of A move at least k elements of X. The Motion Lemma of Russell and Sundaram states that if the motion is at least 2 log2|A|, then the action has distinguishing number two. When X is a vector space, group, or map, the Motion Lemma and elementary estimates of the motion together show that in all but finitely many cases, the action of Aut(X) on X has distinguishing number two. A new lower bound for the motion of any transitive action gives similar results for transitive actions with restricted point-stabilizers.

So far, however, no attention has been given to polyominoes whose columns can have either one or two connected components. This little known kind of polyominoes seems not to be manageable as a whole. To obtain solvable models, one needs to introduce some restrictions. This paper is focused on polyominoes with hexagonal cells. The restrictions just mentioned are semi-directedness and an upper bound (say m) on the size of the gap within a column. As the upper bound m grows, the solution of the model tends to break into more and more cases. We computed the area generating functions for m = 1, m = 2 and m = 3.

We interpret such sets as (weakly) extensional acyclic digraphs—that is, acyclic digraphs whose (non-sink) vertices have pairwise different out-neighborhoods—and employ a Markov chain technique already given for acyclic digraphs.

Efficient computational methods are known for regular covers with cyclic or elementary abelian group of covering transformations CT(℘).

In this paper we consider the lifting problem with an additional condition on how a group should lift: given a connected graph X and a group G of its automorphisms, find all connected regular covering projections ℘: ˜X → X along which G lifts as a sectional split extension. By this we mean that there exists a complement ˉG of CT(℘) within the lifted group ˜G such that ˉG has an orbit intersecting each fibre in at most one vertex.

The iterated 3-wheel W3n is obtained by contracting one of these 3-cycles in C3□ Pn + 1 to a single vertex. Using rooted-graphs, we derive simultaneous recursions for the partitioned genus distributions of W3n and a formula for the genus distribution of the graphs Pr3n. A seemingly straightforward way to construct either the sequence of iterated prisms Pr3n or the sequence of iterated wheels W3n, would be by iterative amalgamation of a copy of C3□ K2, such that a copy of C3 contained in it is matched to the “newest” copy of C3 in the growing graph. Calculating genus distributions for the sequences would then involve an excessively large set of simultaneous recurrences. To avoid this, we propose a method of iterative surgery, under which the same vertex is considered a root-vertex in all graphs of the sequence, and in which the successive calculations of genus distributions require only four simultaneous recurrences.

In this paper we study these relations in connection with certain properties of automorphism groups of transitive digraphs. In particular, one of the main results shows that if a transitive digraph admits a nilpotent subgroup of automorphisms with finitely many orbits, then its nilpotency class and the number of orbits are closely related to particular properties of reachability relations defined on the digraphs in question.
The obtained results have interesting implications for Cayley digraphs of certain types of groups such as torsion-free groups of polynomial growth.

The concept of two-fold isomorphisms, as far as we know, first appeared in Zelinka’s work on isotopies of digraphs and later studied formally by the authors with a greater emphasis on undirected graphs. We then turn our attention to the stability of graphs which have every edge on a triangle, but with the fresh outlook provided by TF-automorphisms. Amongst such graphs are strongly regular graphs with certain parameters. The advantages of this fresh outlook are highlighted when we ultimately present a method of constructing and generating unstable graphs with large diameter having every edge lying on a triangle.

We recall algorithms for finding decompositions of this type that are based on semidefinite programming. The main part of the article investigates how to find such decomposition with rational coefficients if the original polynomial has rational coefficients. We show that the numerical evidence, obtained by the Gram matrix method and semidefinite programming, which is usually an almost feasible point, can be frequently tweaked to obtain an exact certificate using rational numbers. In the presence of Slater points, the Peyrl-Parrilo rounding and projecting method applies. On the other hand, in the absence of strict feasibility, a variant of the facial reduction is proposed to reduce the size of the semidefinite program and to enforce the existence of Slater points. All these methods are implemented in our open source computer algebra package NCSOStools. Throughout the paper many worked out examples are presented to illustrate our results.",2014-11-28,ARS MATHEMATICA CONTEMPORANEA,https://amc-journal.eu/index.php/amc/article/view/518,9,2,243,259,262
DP FAMNIT,Fast recognition of partial star products and quasi cartesian products,10.26493/1855-3974.520.933,CC BY 4.0,"This paper is concerned with the fast computation of a relation d on the edge set of connected graphs that plays a decisive role in the recognition of approximate Cartesian products, the weak reconstruction of Cartesian products, and the recognition of Cartesian graph bundles with a triangle free basis.

A special case of d is the relation δ*, whose convex closure yields the product relation σ that induces the prime factor decomposition of connected graphs with respect to the Cartesian product. For the construction of d so-called Partial Star Products are of particular interest. Several special data structures are used that allow to compute Partial Star Products in constant time. These computations are tuned to the recognition of approximate graph products, but also lead to a linear time algorithm for the computation of δ* for graphs with maximum bounded degree.

Furthermore, we define quasi Cartesian products as graphs with non-trivial δ*. We provide several examples, and show that quasi Cartesian products can be recognized in linear time for graphs with bounded maximum degree. Finally, we note that quasi products can be recognized in sublinear time with a parallelized algorithm.",2014-11-28,ARS MATHEMATICA CONTEMPORANEA,https://amc-journal.eu/index.php/amc/article/view/520,9,2,223,242,263

Instead,  we show that the minimal required information about the action and the 2-cocycle can  be effectively decoded directly from voltages (without explicitly constructing the cover and the lifted group); one could then use the standard method by reducing the problem to solving a linear system of equations over the integers. However, along these lines we here take a slightly different approach which  even  does not require any knowledge of cohomology.

The aim of the paper is to provide a few criteria for the involution tau acting on a graph X of genus g to be gamma-hyperelliptic. If tau has at least one fixed point then the first criterium states that there is a basis in the homology group H_1(X) whose elements are either invertible or split into gamma interchangeable pairs under the action of tau_*.

The data that determine the lifted group and its action are then conveniently encoded in terms of voltages as well. Along these lines, an algorithm for testing whether the lifted group is a split extension of the group of covering transformations has recently been proposed in the case when the group of covering transformations is solvable. It consists of decomposing the covering into a series of coverings with elementary abelian groups of covering transformations, and inductively solving the problem at every elementary abelian step. Although the explicit construction of the lifted group is not needed, it still involves time and space consuming constructions of certain subgroups in the lifted group at every step except at the final one.

In this paper, an improved version that completely avoids such constructions is presented. From voltage distribution we first compute the weak action and the factor set that determine the lifted group, and we then carry out the test by extracting the necessary information only from the corresponding weak actions and factor sets at every step.

Two configurations are adjacent if one can be transformed to the other by moving a single token along an edge to an adjacent vertex. We present propositions related to the structural properties of reduced graph powers and, most significantly, provide a construction of minimum cycle bases of G(k).

The minimum cycle basis construction is an interesting combinatorial problem that is also useful in applications involving configuration spaces. For example, if G is the state-transition graph of a Markov chain model of a stochastic automaton, the reduced power G(k) is the state-transition graph for k identical (but not necessarily independent) automata.

The game ends when all the vertices have been colored. Then Gentle wins if the d-coloring is distinguishing and Rascal wins otherwise.

The conjecture is that the edge-chromatic number is the maximum degree, except when simple arithmetic forces the edge-chromatic number to be one greater than the maximum degree. For Mycielski graphs, we strengthen an old result that the graphs are Hamiltonian by showing that they are Hamilton-connected (except M3, which is a cycle).

Moreover, some of them do not even admit realizations with pseudoline arrangements, i.e., they are not topological. In this paper we generalize the concept of topological configurations to a more general one (in a least possible way) such that every combinatorial configuration is realizable in this way.

In particular, we generalize the notion of a pseudoline arrangement to the notion of a quasiline arrangement by relaxing the condition that two pseudolines meet exactly once. We also generalize well-known tools from pseudoline arrangements such as sweeps and wiring diagrams. We introduce monotone quasiline arrangements as a subfamily of quasiline arrangements that can be represented with generalized wiring diagrams. We show that every incidence structure (and therefore also every combinatorial configuration) can be realized as a monotone quasiline arrangement in the real projective plane.

A quasiline arrangement with selected vertices belonging to an incidence structure can be viewed as a map on a closed surface. Such a map can be used to distinguish between two “distinct” realizations of an incidence structure as a quasiline arrangement.",2017-06-18,ARS MATHEMATICA CONTEMPORANEA,https://amc-journal.eu/index.php/amc/article/view/1109,14,1,97,116,434

These include the cycle double cover conjecture, Tutte’s 5-flow conjecture, Fulkerson’s conjecture, and several others. One way of approaching these conjectures is through the study of structural properties of snarks and construction of small examples with given properties. In this paper we deal with the problem of determining the smallest order of a nontrivial snark (that is, one which is cyclically 4-edge-connected and has girth at least 5) of oddness at least 4. Using a combination of structural analysis with extensive computations we prove that the smallest order of a snark with oddness at least 4 and cyclic connectivity 4 is 44.

Following analogous studies in the literature related to independent sets, dominating sets, and total dominating sets, we study in this paper the class of graphs in which the connected dominating sets can be separated from the other vertex subsets by a linear weight function. More precisely, we say that a graph is connected-domishold if it admits non-negative real weights associated to its vertices such that a set of vertices is a connected dominating set if and only if the sum of the corresponding weights exceeds a certain threshold. We characterize the graphs in this non-hereditary class in terms of a property of the set of minimal cutsets of the graph. We give several characterizations for the hereditary case, that is, when each connected induced subgraph is required to be connected-domishold. The characterization by forbidden induced subgraphs implies that the class properly generalizes two well known classes of chordal graphs, the block graphs and the trivially perfect graphs. Finally, we study certain algorithmic aspects of connected-domishold graphs. Building on connections with minimal cutsets and properties of the derived hypergraphs and Boolean functions, we show that our approach leads to new polynomially solvable cases of the weighted connected dominating set problem.",2019-03-15,ARS MATHEMATICA CONTEMPORANEA,https://amc-journal.eu/index.php/amc/article/view/1330,16,2,487,525,539

A dessin is regular if its group of orientation- and colour-preserving automorphisms acts regularly on the edges. In this paper we study regular dessins whose underlying graph is a complete bipartite graph Km, n, called (m, n)-complete regular dessins. The purpose is to establish a rather surprising correspondence between (m, n)-complete regular dessins and pairs of skew-morphisms of cyclic groups. A skew-morphism of a finite group A is a bijection φ: A → A that satisfies the identity φ(xy) = φ(x)φπ(x)(y) for some function π: A → ℤ and fixes the neutral element of A. We show that every (m, n)-complete regular dessin D determines a pair of reciprocal skew-morphisms of the cyclic groups ℤn and ℤm. Conversely, D can be reconstructed from such a reciprocal pair. As a consequence, we prove that complete regular dessins, exact bicyclic groups with a distinguished pair of generators, and pairs of reciprocal skew-morphisms of cyclic groups are all in a one-to-one correspondence. Finally, we apply the main result to determining all pairs of integers m and n for which there exists, up to interchange of colours, exactly one isomorphism class of (m, n)-complete regular dessins.

We use the method to produce and recover maximal green sequences for many bipartite recurrent quivers that show up in the study of periodicity of T-systems and Y-systems. Additionally, we show how our method relates to the dominance phenomenon recently considered by Reading. Given a maximal green sequence produced by our method, this relation to dominance gives a maximal green sequence for infinitely many other quivers.
